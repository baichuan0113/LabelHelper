What is the best practice for labeling each object of interest in images for computer vision?,"You should label every appearance of each object of interest in every image to avoid introducing false negatives into the training data. For example, in a chess piece dataset, label every single piece on the board, including all white pawns."
How should bounding boxes be used when labeling objects in images?,"Bounding boxes should enclose the entirety of an object, even if the object is occluded. The boxes should be tight but not so close that they cut off part of the object. This helps the model accurately learn what pixels constitute an object."
How should occluded objects be labeled in computer vision tasks?,"Occluded objects should be labeled as if they were fully visible, using bounding boxes that assume the complete shape of the object. This includes labeling occluded objects even if their bounding boxes overlap with others."
What considerations should be made when naming labels for objects in image datasets?,"Labels should be specific. For example, rather than labeling all objects as ""dog,"" it's better to label them as ""labrador"" or ""poodle"" if differentiating between breeds is important. Specific labels can later be generalized if necessary."
What are the benefits of using professional labelers for image labeling tasks?,"Professional labelers can ensure accuracy and efficiency in labeling large datasets. Services like Roboflow’s Outsource Labeling manage workforces trained in specific labeling tasks, helping to curate high-quality datasets faster and at a lower cost."
How important are labeling instructions and examples in the image labeling process?,"Clear and detailed labeling instructions are crucial. Providing both positive and negative examples helps labelers understand exactly what is expected, reducing confusion and ensuring consistency across the dataset."
What tools and services does Roboflow offer to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of image labeling?,"Roboflow provides tools such as Label Assist and Smart Polygon for efficient annotations, and services like Outsource Labeling where customers can engage with third-party labelers to handle large-scale annotation tasks effectively."
